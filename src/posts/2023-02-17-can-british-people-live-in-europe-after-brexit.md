I have always felt the need to travel, to see other countries, meet other people, investigate other cultures and habits. I have wanted to connect with other humans. I am less interested in what divides us. I like to know the issues but differences are less interesting in comparison to what unites us.

I have managed to travel and have adventures even when it has been difficult to finance. I have lived in other countries. France and Malta in particular.

So that is what my articles will be about. What it is like to travel to other countries. What is it like to live as an expat. How are visitors perceived, what are their experiences. Your contributions are welcome

We will review books, videos and podcasts that are about travelling to other countries and across continents, or living in those countries as an expat. This section will be called The Armchair Traveller after a blog I used to write many years ago. I miss it.

Even though this is a UK based website, by it's very nature, we will be talking about everything and anything to do with travel and living away from wherever you started.
